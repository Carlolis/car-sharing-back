# Configuration Changes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to implement ZIO Config for loading configuration from files.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added ZIO Config Dependencies
Added the following dependencies to `bleep.yaml`:
- `dev.zio::zio-config:4.0.0-RC16`
- `dev.zio::zio-config-magnolia:4.0.0-RC16`
- `dev.zio::zio-config-typesafe:4.0.0-RC16`

### 2. Created Configuration Files
- Created `application.conf` with default values and environment variable overrides
- Created `application.conf.example` as a template for developers

### 3. Updated Configuration Classes
- Modified `WebDavConfig` to use ZIO Config for loading from application.conf
- Modified `AuthConfig` to use ZIO Config for loading from application.conf
- Updated `AppConfig` to provide a configuredLayer that loads the entire configuration

### 4. Updated Application Code
- Updated `Main.scala` to use AppConfig.configuredLayer instead of individual config layers
- Updated `InvoiceStorageTest` to use AppConfig.testLayer for tests

### 5. Documentation and Version Control
- Added .gitignore entry to exclude application.conf from version control
- Updated README.md with configuration setup instructions

## Benefits
- Configuration is now centralized in a dedicated file
- Environment variables are used in production
- Hardcoded values are used for tests
- Sensitive configuration is not committed to version control
- Consistent configuration approach across the application
